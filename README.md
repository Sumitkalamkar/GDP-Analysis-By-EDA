# GDP-Analysis-By-EDA
# GDP Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of GDP data, aimed at identifying patterns, trends, and insights into economic performance across various countries. The project leverages interactive and static visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Project Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the GDP dataset for analysis.
- **Feature Analysis**: Exploring key columns such as country names, country codes, years, and GDP values.
- **Visualization**: Using both static and interactive visualizations to illustrate trends and patterns.
- **Advanced Insights**: Calculating GDP percentage growth year-over-year for individual countries.

## Dataset
The dataset (`gdp.csv`) includes:
- Country names and codes.
- Yearly GDP values.
- Relevant indicators for economic analysis.

## Tools and Libraries
This project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy` for numerical computations.
- `matplotlib` for static visualizations.
- `plotly` for creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.
- Jupyter Notebook for an interactive coding environment.

## Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Loading**: Importing the GDP dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values and ensuring consistency in the dataset.
3. **Descriptive Analysis**: Generating summary statistics and exploring key metrics.
4. **Static Visualizations**: Creating line graphs to analyze GDP trends over time.
5. **Interactive Visualizations**: Using Plotly to explore relationships dynamically.
6. **Advanced Metrics**: Computing GDP growth percentages and examining country-specific trends.

## Visualizations
The project includes:
- Line charts to show GDP trends over time.
- Bar charts for country-wise comparisons.
- Interactive dashboards using Plotly for enhanced data exploration.
- Heatmaps and other visuals to explore feature correlations.

## How to Use This Repository
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gdp-analysis.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd gdp-analysis
   ```
3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Results
The analysis provides:
- Insights into GDP trends and their influencing factors.
- Identification of high-growth and low-growth regions.
- Country-wise comparison of GDP changes over time.

## Future Work
- Expand the dataset to include additional economic indicators.
- Build predictive models to forecast GDP trends.
- Integrate interactive dashboards for real-time data exploration.
